# Fictional Others & Fictional Crushes Submod for MAS
Sup sillies!! This is my first attempt at doing a Submod by myself! <p>
This is dedicated to all the silly critters like me who want to hold hands with multiple fictional characters. Once I've reached the 400 affection points required to be able to give Monika the promise ring I've grown a little guilty fro not being able to tell her that there are some fictional characters that I'm very silly for that she, of course, doesn't know about... So I wanted to make a wholesome interaction where you open up about it with her and she reassures you that she loves you nonetheless! And so do you!
  
## How does it work? What are the requirements?
Just download the latest release and extract everything in the `Submods` folder! Easy! <p>
The interaction will be unlocked after the ***ENAMORED*** affection level is reached, it makes it a little more realistic since that, once Monika is enamored, the player will start growing guilty about not informing her about their fictional crushes, therefore the dialogue will be available <p>
The interaction is situated in the ***"Us..."*** section in the *"Hey, Monika..."* menu, it is labelled as ***"There's something I think you should know...."*** <p>
The rest will be left for the player to continue
      
## Updates
This Submod is compatible with the MAS [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)!! <p>
I look forward to adding some more stuff and options and polish everything a little!
